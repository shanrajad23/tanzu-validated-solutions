# VMware Tanzu Application Platform Networking

The following Tanzu Application Platform (informally known as TAP) networking diagram shows the most common cross-cluster and external-services networking scenarios in a multi cluster Kubernetes environment. The diagram shows the high level egress and ingress networking flows between the Tanzu Application Platform components and the external services.

The following table describes the networking flow in the Tanzu Application Platform networking diagram.

| Component / External Service | Source   | Destination | Port | Protocol | Description
